#### Folder: GetMissingLetters

The sentence "A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" contains every single letter in the alphabet. Such sentences are called pangrams.

You are to write a method ‘GetMissingLetters’ using a language of your choice, which takes a String, a sentence, and returns all the letters it is missing (which prevent it from being a pangram).

You should ignore the case of the letters in sentence, and your return should be all lower case letters, in alphabetical order.

You should also ignore all non US-ASCII characters.

The code you submit must contain a method that conforms to the expected method signature, as follows:

Public Class: MissingLetters

Method signature: public String GetMissingLetters(String sentence)


#### Folder: GetMaximumSum

By starting at the top of the triangle and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 27.

5
9 6
4 6 8
0 7 1 5

i.e. 5 + 9 + 6 + 7 = 27.

Write a program using a language of your choice to find the maximum total from top to bottom in a text file containing a triangle with 100 rows.
